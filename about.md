I'm an expert for software development, primarily focused on Web technology. I'm also a teacher, author, and geek.

### Technologies I Use

* .NET, C#, Visual Studio, WCF, Entity Framework
* NodeJS, Express, Pug
* TypeScript (JavaScript)
* Angular / React

### Other Stuff I Do

I wrote text books. Meanwhile I have roughly 60, most with major publishers. Few in English (see Apress). A few more in my sef-publishing project __texxtoor__.

### Private

I read Sci-Fi. Mostly on my Kindle. This is a computer, too. Hence, when I'm reading I'm still with a computer.

I tinker, solder electronics, build stuff. Created a smart home. And a smart garden. All with computers, of course.

I play golf. It's the only way to get me away from a computer.
